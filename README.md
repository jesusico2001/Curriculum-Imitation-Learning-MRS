# Curriculum Imitation Learning of Distributed Multi-Robot Policies

This repository contains the implementation of a *curriculum learning* algorithm for distributed navigation policies in Multi-Robots Systems. This algorithm schedules the difficulty of training trajectories and dynamically fragments demonstrations to match the scheduled difficulty.
The project also includes a module for analytical ground truth data generation in 3 scenarios (Fixed Swapping, Time-Varying Swapping and Flocking). Finally, various neural network architectures (MLP, GNN, LEMURS) in which the performance of the algorithm is evaluated.
